Visualisation and Analysis of Vehicular Delay Tolerant Networks(DTNs).

## Usecase

We take into consideration the bus transport schedules from various cities in the world to simulate and evaluate performance of content distribution in the city using vehicular DTN.
We make use of GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) files provided by transport agencies from different cities for this purpose.

## Current Assumptions

We consider that the communication is restricted to `Bus-BusStop` for the moment.

## Experimental Scenario

Simulation and performance evalution of content distribution using the following algorithms

```
1) Flooding
2) Reverse-Path Broadcasting
3) Edmond Chunli
4) Optimal Algorithm developed by us.
```
